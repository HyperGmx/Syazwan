		<h1>NIGHT MARKET</h1>
		<P>When I was in school again at the age of 15 I was working at the night market for following my cousin who traded there.<br> This is because I want to gain experience in working and earn an income to support me while I go to school.<br> And also I want to help my family in covering the expenses at home in terms of food supply because my mother is a housewife and only father works.</P>
